            <p>My professional career began at Gulfcon Inc., an engineering firm that contracts for TotalEnergies, a French multinational integrated energy and petroleum company that is one of the seven supermajor oil companies. I first began as Engineer I, working on documentation and configuration of the upcoming Turnaround that the refinery was going to go through in the fall. During my tenure as Engineer I, I would use Autodesk Inventor, Kofax, and the standard Microsoft Office suite to pull together work orders for parts that needed to be replaced during the upcoming turnaround, including sight glasses, orifice plates, and basic instrumentation for the Naphtha Hydrotreater Reformer unit (NHTR) and the Sulfolane BTX unit (SBTX.)</p>

            </div>
            <p>I was promoted several months later to Process Controls Engineer, working amongst a group of thoroughly experienced Process Control and Advanced Process Control Engineers. I gained experience using plant monitoring, data historian, and process monitoring softwares such as PI AF, PI Vision, Experion PKS, Dynamo Alarm Management, and more. I completed projects and assignments such as backfilling and clearing faulty or inaccurate data for monthly environmental emissions reports, creating/deleting PI points for new steps in the refining process, and creating multi-sheet macros to incorporate a once-static Op-Plan for the plant into the operator's display board.</p>
            <p>I am still currently working as a Process Controls Engineer, but my contract with Gulfcon is set to expire in May of next year, so I am in the process of seeking employment at another engineering firm. With experience in a plant setting, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to future projects at other companies, and am certain that I can make strides to reach my goal of a leadership position.</p>
