            <h3>Hydroelectric Generator Design</h3>

            <p>Hydroelectric energy is a popular renewable energy source that is often utilized by landowners as a method of producing free electricity. This design of a hydroelectric generator was requested by the client to provide him with off-the grid power, capable of powering a few small devices. Most hydroelectric generation happens on a large industrial scale, so the challenge faced by the group was to construct a micro-generator without losing too much efficiency. This design was built with the parameters of a low head, high volume flow, and is oriented as a battery design, instead of a traditional generator build. The turbine spins an alternator, which in turn powers the battery, before sending the power through an inverter for client use.</p>

            <p>For the micro hydroelectric generator project, my team combined Computational Fluid Dynamics (C.F.D.) analysis, hand calculations, and Fusion 360 modeling to ensure success. Hand calculations provided basic estimates and insights, while C.F.D. analysis allows the visualization of water flow through the turbine design. This ensured the generator produces maximum energy while maintaining strength and reliability. </p>
            <h3>Heating Vest</h3>

            <p>The heating vest project aimed to create a comfortable and efficient solution for outdoor enthusiasts facing cold weather conditions. By integrating flexible heating elements into a lightweight vest, my team sought to provide adjustable warmth without compromising mobility. The design process involved selecting appropriate materials, determining optimal heating zones, and ensuring user safety through effective insulation and temperature control.</p>
