            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I grew up in Southeast Texas as the second-youngest child from a family of ten. My siblings paved the way for me as successful academics, and inspired me to pursue a worthwhile degree at a great school. I elected to study Mechanical Engineering at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology in Rapid City, South Dakota. </p>
            <p>I was the first student athlete in my family in college, and played for three years at SD Mines as a captain and starter. However after three years of an unhappy tenure in Rapid City, I transferred schools to West Texas A&M University to pursue a higher quality of athletics and in-state tuition. I finished my degree in Mechanical Engineering and immediately began pursuing my Master's of Science in Finance and Economics online through West Texas A&M.</p>

            </div>
            <p>I am currently working at a refinery in Texas as a Process Controls Engineer, and am looking to expand my experience by diversifying my professional background in economics and finance areas. My goal is to end up in a leadership position in an engineering firm where I can display my skills and knowledge effectively.</p>
            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>I have been playing soccer for over 20 years, and I consider it to be a significant part of my understanding of the world. In soccer you must always be aware of your surroundings, understand others so that you may function as a team, sacrifice for the benefit of others, work hard, defend, go forward, and transition. Sports, like life, reflect your effort on you with results and rewards. "You get what you give" has been a principle that I have always lived by in soccer, and it carries over into my professional life as well.</p>
            <p>In addition to playing soccer, I also enjoy coaching. I coach a high school team part time as an Assistant Coach, and try to help high school juniors and seniors with the college-recruiting process so that they may have the opportunity to experience the privilege of being a collegiate athlete.</p>
